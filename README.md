  Assorted very basic useful scripts
</h1>

A centralized repository of some useful scripts.

<h3>add_user.sh</h3>
  Syntax: `add_user.sh <i>name_of_user</i> creates a user on a server with ability to become root. The user's key must then still be copied into '<i>name_of_user<i>/.ssh/authorized_keys`

<h3>install_node.sh</h3>
  Syntax: `install_node.sh <i>version.of.node</i>` installs the specified version of node. The version should be without the letter v, so `10.15.3` as opposed to `v10.15.3`

<h3>reimage_script.sh</h3>
  Running this script will reinstall many commonly used packages and applications on a fresh ubuntu box.
